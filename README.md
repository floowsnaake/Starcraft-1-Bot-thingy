# Starcraft-1-Bot-thingy
This is a personal bot/thingy im making for Starcraft

This is a simple Throw together Starcraft 1 bot/autohotkey script to read the games memory in a super quick and dirty way


You need Authotkey https://autohotkey.com/ if you want to edit the .ahk file and also you might need to update the starcraft.exe name and also need to chnage the pointers in the script.
